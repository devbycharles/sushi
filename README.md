# Sushi

## Project

- In this project, I built a website using React to simulate how a sushi restaurant would operate online. Users are able to add food items to their cart and view those items in the cart along with associated costs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript ES6+
- React.js
- React Router

### What I learned

- How to make a cart with items in it
- How to use a function to increase costs with every new item added
- How to lazy load
